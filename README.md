# Java Project

A full java project developed with the goal to create a similar game like Donkey-Kong

## ℹ️ Main Features

- It's a classic arcade game, where I (user) can control a character called Jump-Man inside a room with platforms and stairs
- In that room there's Donkey Kong, a villain which movement is independent from Jump-Man's movement, throwing several atacks to our character
- Basically, the main goal is to move Jump-Man along three levels (three diferent rooms) to rescue the princess
- The layout of the rooms will have a highest score of difficulty as Jump-Man will pass to another level
- When the princess is rescued, a message appears to registe the name of the player in that play
- If the file was not created in the beginning, after the first play, will be created a highscores.txt automatically, with all the plays and how much time the player took to rescue the princess

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Install Eclipse IDE for java developers (the latest version)
   - [You can install it here](https://eclipseide.org/)

## ⚙️ How to run the game

- If you don't have any version of Java, you may have to install Java (JDK) for developers 
   - (Just search for "Java jdk download")
- Go to File -> Open projects from file System -> Archive -> Import the project.zip
- With the project imported, go to main.java (inside src folder) and then you just have to click on run and start playing
